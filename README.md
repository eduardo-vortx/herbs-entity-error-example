1. clone this repo
0. enter this project directory
0. run `npm i` to install the dependencies
0. run `run npm test` to run the test

The test will pass.

To simulate the error I am facing, open the file `src/usecases/create-order.js` and uncomment the line `31`. Then run the tests again. It will raise the error.
